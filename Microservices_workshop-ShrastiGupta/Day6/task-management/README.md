## Core Security Concepts

---

### 1. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- **Authentication** verifies *who* the user is (login).
- **Authorization** checks *what* the user is allowed to do (permissions, roles).

---

### 2. How does Spring Security handle the authentication flow for form login?
- Spring intercepts the login form POST request at `/login`, validates credentials via `AuthenticationManager`, and stores the result in `SecurityContextHolder`.

---

### 3. How is a stateless JWT flow different from session-based auth?
- **JWT** stores user data in a signed token sent with every request â€” no server memory used.
- **Session-based** stores user state on the server, typically using cookies.

---

### 4. How do filters in Spring Security get executed and ordered?
- Filters are executed in a specific **predefined order** within Spring Securityâ€™s `FilterChainProxy`.
- You can customize the order using `@Order` or `SecurityFilterChain`.

---

### 5. What role does the `SecurityContextHolder` play?
- It holds the **current user's security context**, including authentication and authorities.
- It's used throughout the app to retrieve user details securely.

---

### 6. Why should CSRF be disabled for JWT-based APIs?
- JWT APIs are **stateless** and do not use cookies, making CSRF protection unnecessary.
- CSRF is relevant for session-based apps where cookies are auto-included in requests.

---

### 7. What is MDC and how does it help with audit/log tracing?
- **Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)** stores contextual info like request ID or user ID per thread.
- It enhances logs by adding traceable metadata across logs in a request lifecycle.

---

### 8. What are the security risks of not validating a JWT token signature?
- Attackers can forge tokens and impersonate users if signature verification is skipped.
- Always validate JWT signatures to ensure authenticity and integrity.

---

### 9. How can you revoke or expire JWTs?
- Use a **short expiration time** and **refresh tokens**.
- For real-time revocation, maintain a token blacklist or store invalidated tokens in Redis.

---

### 10. What is the purpose of enabling or customizing CORS?
- CORS allows browsers to access APIs across different domains.
- Customizing it ensures only **trusted domains** can call your backend APIs.
